# Fourier Transform and Frequency Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the **Fourier Transform (FT)** and its application in extracting frequency components from signals. Whether you're an audio enthusiast or diving into signal processing, this project provides a hands-on approach to understanding the FT and its nuances.

## 🚀 Features
- Step-by-step implementation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).
- Visualization of the **magnitude spectrum** to analyze signal frequencies.
- Explanation of the **Nyquist frequency**, mirroring, and aliasing.
- Use of Python libraries like `NumPy` and `Matplotlib`.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib
