# Extracting Fourier Transform from Audio Signals

This project demonstrates the process of extracting frequency-domain features from audio signals using the **Fourier Transform (FT)**. It serves as an educational resource for understanding how the Fourier Transform can be applied to real-world audio data for signal processing tasks.

## üìñ Overview

The Fourier Transform is a cornerstone in signal processing, enabling the decomposition of a signal into its frequency components. This notebook provides a practical implementation for extracting these features from audio signals, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications.

## üîç Key Highlights

1. **Preprocessing Audio Data**:
   - Load audio files and visualize their time-domain waveform using Python libraries like `librosa` and `matplotlib`.
   - Understand the structure and characteristics of audio signals.

2. **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**:
   - Apply the Fourier Transform to convert time-domain signals into the frequency domain.
   - Analyze the magnitude spectrum to identify dominant frequencies.

3. **Visualization and Analysis**:
   - Plot the frequency spectrum of audio signals for intuitive understanding.
   - Highlight key aspects like the Nyquist frequency and aliasing.

4. **Practical Insights**:
   - Learn how these methods can be applied to audio feature extraction tasks in speech recognition and audio analysis.
