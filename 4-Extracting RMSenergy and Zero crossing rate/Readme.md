# Extracting RMS Energy and Zero Crossing Rate

## Introduction
This folder focuses on feature extraction techniques, particularly the calculation of RMS energy and zero crossing rate (ZCR) from audio signals.

## Summary
- **RMS Energy**: Measures the energy content in audio, often used to determine loudness.
- **Zero Crossing Rate**: Counts the number of times the signal crosses the zero amplitude level, indicating frequency characteristics.

## Intuition
RMS energy and ZCR are fundamental audio features. RMS energy provides a measure of the power of a signal, while ZCR gives insights into its frequency behavior. These features are especially useful in tasks like speech/music detection and sound classification.
