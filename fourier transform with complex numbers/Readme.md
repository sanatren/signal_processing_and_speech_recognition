# Fourier Transform Using Complex Numbers

## Introduction
This folder dives into the mathematical foundations of the Fourier Transform, emphasizing the use of complex numbers. Complex numbers enable encoding of both magnitude and phase information, making the Fourier Transform a powerful tool for signal analysis.

## Summary
- Explains how the Fourier Transform is defined in terms of complex numbers.
- Demonstrates the polar representation of Fourier coefficients (magnitude and phase).
- Provides visualizations of Fourier coefficients in the complex plane.

## Intuition
Complex numbers make it possible to represent both the amplitude (magnitude) and timing (phase) of a signal's frequency components. The Fourier Transform maps these components to points in the complex plane, where the distance from the origin represents magnitude, and the angle represents phase.

## Features
- Learn the basics of complex number representation in Fourier Transform.
- Visualize Fourier coefficients in the complex plane.
- Gain a deeper understanding of how magnitude and phase relate to signal properties.
