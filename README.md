# Speech Recognition Repository

## Introduction
This repository explores various techniques and tools for speech recognition, with a focus on audio signal processing and PyTorch-based deep learning. The included folders each focus on specific aspects of the speech recognition pipeline.

## Folder Descriptions
1. **Audio&DL through Pytorch**: Demonstrates PyTorch-based audio deep learning techniques.
2. **Extracting RMSenergy and Zero crossing rate**: Explores feature extraction techniques like RMS energy and ZCR.
3. **extracting time domain features**: Focuses on extracting time-domain features from audio signals.
4. **input_speech**: Contains input datasets or speech files for testing and training.
5. **.idea**: Stores IDE configuration files.

## Intuition
Speech recognition involves a combination of signal processing and machine learning techniques. This repository systematically explores these aspects, providing insights into both the theoretical and practical sides of audio-based machine learning.
