In this directory i implemented and understood audio types and .wav file which is best for speech recognition since it gives the best data of voice because it does not compress the audio file 
we dont lose the audio which is important for speech recognition for training AI models and etc.

In audio.py file i implemented how to open .wav file files and explored their parameters which are important for audios later saved it then created my own output_file1.wav by setting 
up new values of parameters or same and same frames values to creat a new audio file

In plottingwav file i plotted the audio signal graph  on the bases of time and frames for the output_file1.wav which i created earlier.

In recormic.py file i learned and understood pyaudio how it wirks by setting some parameters of audio through stream and running it for some time for frames per buffer to get 
the audio input from the user and then created the myname.wav the output file with same parameters as given in stream to get the audio of user .
