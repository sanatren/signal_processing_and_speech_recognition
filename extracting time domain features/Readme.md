# Extracting Time Domain Features

## Introduction
This folder contains scripts for extracting time-domain features from audio signals, which are critical for analyzing temporal characteristics.

## Summary
- **Features**: Includes calculations like amplitude envelope, energy, and temporal centroid.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for audio classification, speech recognition, and general audio analysis.

## Intuition
Time-domain features capture the raw temporal structure of an audio signal, providing a baseline understanding before delving into frequency or spectral analysis. This folder highlights foundational steps in processing audio data.
