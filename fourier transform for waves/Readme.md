# Fourier Transform for Waves

## Introduction
This folder focuses on applying the Fourier Transform to analyze waves and audio signals. The Fourier Transform converts signals from the time domain to the frequency domain, enabling an understanding of the frequency components of the signal.

## Summary
- Implements the Fourier Transform on simple waves and audio signals.
- Demonstrates how to visualize signals in the frequency domain.
- Likely includes scripts for computing and plotting the magnitude and phase spectra.

## Intuition
The Fourier Transform decomposes a signal into its frequency components, providing a spectral view of the signal. This is useful for understanding the characteristics of audio signals, identifying dominant frequencies, and performing tasks like filtering and noise reduction.

## Features
- Apply the Fourier Transform to periodic signals.
- Visualize the frequency domain representation of signals.
- Use real-world examples to demonstrate practical applications of the Fourier Transform.
