# Audio and Deep Learning through PyTorch

## Introduction
This folder contains scripts and resources for audio signal processing and deep learning experiments using the PyTorch framework. The focus is on implementing deep learning models to analyze and process audio data.

## Summary
- Demonstrates the integration of PyTorch for handling audio signals.
- Includes examples of preprocessing, feature extraction, and training simple neural networks on audio datasets.
- Likely explores concepts like spectrogram generation, audio data augmentation, and model evaluation.

## Intuition
PyTorch is a powerful framework for deep learning, and applying it to audio data involves preprocessing steps like feature extraction and spectrogram conversion. This folder bridges the gap between raw audio and deep learning, showing how to train and evaluate models effectively.
